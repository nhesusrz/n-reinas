Introduction to Evolutionary Computing: N-Queen Problem
=======
I implemented an application that solves the problem of the n-queens by an evolutionary algorithm using the JGAP framework.
The user of the application has the ability to configure: the n parameter of the issue mentioned, and the different parameters and operators of the evolutionary algorithm. Moreover, the application allows you to record the results of each executions.
